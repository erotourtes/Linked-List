# Linked-List

* The four principles of object-oriented programming are:

- Encapsulation: bundling the data and operations on the data inside
a single unit (class). 
- Abstraction: reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary details
(metaphor: the implementation detail of a remote control is hidden
from us. We only work with its public interface.) (private)
- Inheritance: a mechanism for reusing code. (extend)
- Polymorphism: a mechanism that allows an object to take many
forms and behave differently. This will help us build extensible
applications. (interfaces, parent classes)
